# r570scripts
This repository contains scripts to build and explore the R570 hybrid sugarcane genome assembly. These scripts are not a pipeline to re-create the assembly, but instead are presented here to complement the genome assembly methods presented in the supplementary material of the associated manuscript. 
**Note** A link to the article and the supplementary information will be provided here upon publication.
